LittleBigKeyboard for Android devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LittleBigKeyboard is a virtual keyboard (an Android input method, IME)
a user can install to replace the built in virtual keyboard.

Features:

- Made for small screens (or big finger): big buttons.

- Small screen space occupied. Height is only 3 key-rows.

- A fairly novel input technique: press key as normal for center letter or
  press and move away from key to select side letters.

- Letter placement optimized for a mix of English and Swedish language
  input but layout includes most Western Europe letters.

- Non-predictive. You always know what will happen when you press
  something.

- All letters repeat like a normal physical keyboard.

INSTALLING
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download and install the package from Android market or compile and
   install yourself.

2. Enable the new input method in "Settings", "Locale & text"
   (Swedish: "Inställningar", "Nationella inställningar & text")

3. Select the new input method by long pressing on any active input form
   (pops up a menu where you can select different input methods).

About author
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original version was created by Thomas Lundqvist based on the
example code (softkeyboard) included in the android development tools.
The motivations were a lack of good big-key keyboards in the market and a
wish to try out some new ideas (new type of input). The input technique is
inspired by for example the Fat Fingers keyboard also found on the market.
